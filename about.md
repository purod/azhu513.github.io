I am currently a senior research scientist of precision medicine at [GNS Healthcare](https://www.gnshealthcare.com/). In my role, I apply statistical methods and build computation tools to analyze genetics data and identify novel therapeutic targets. I also serve as one of the organizers of the [Bay Area Biotech-Pharma Statistics (BBSW) Meetups](https://www.bbsw.org/meetupabout).

I obtained my Master degree in Statistics in 2016 and my PhD degree in Bioinformatics graduated with a PhD in 2019, both from [The University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/). I worked with [Dr. Michael Love](https://mikelove.github.io) and [Dr. Joseph Ibrahim](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/joseph-g-ibrahim-phd/) to develop statistical methods for sequence count data and integrative functional genomics. During my PhD I worked at the [Biostatistics Core](https://unclineberger.org/biostats/) of [Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://unclineberger.org/) collaborating with oncologists on multiple clinical and genomics studies. I also worked with [Dr. Donglin Zeng](http://bios.unc.edu/~dzeng/) on estimating and testing causal effects of drug/drug-drug interactions with electronic medical records (EMR).

<!--I am originally from China, and was born and raised in Shandong. During my senior year at [The Shandong University](https://english.cueb.edu.cn/) (首都经济贸易大学) majoring in Biology, I realized that I am more interested in developing and applying statistical methods to answer healthcare questions. This idea motivated my decision to apply to graduate school in Statistics, Bioinformatics, and Machine Learning to join biotech industry upon graduation.-->

My favorite statistics quote is "*All models are wrong, but some are useful.*" by statistician George Box.
